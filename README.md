My own attempt of a headless WooCommerce shop. Here is the included stack. Evaluating the development experience of HTMX and Alpine JS. 

* Bootstrap 5
* HTMX
* AlpineJS
* Latte PHP templating 
* Dependencies managed with Composer with PSR4 autoloading. 

## Installation 

Auth key example is in .env.example - Switch out with your own keys. 

Run `composer install`

Zip it up. 

Install it with wordpress.

## HTMX evaluation so far

It was a bit tricky to set this up on the backend because wordpress is json response focused, but once working it seems to work well.

## Alpine JS evaluation so far

Zero setup on the backend therefore zero maintence.
